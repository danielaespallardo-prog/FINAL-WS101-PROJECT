Changes made via Lovable will be committed automatically to this repo.

**Use your preferred IDE**

If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in Lovable.

git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

## Local demo features

- Product persistence: products you add via the **Add Product** modal are saved to browser localStorage under the key `artisan-saved-products`. To test:
  1. Sign in as an **Artisan** (select role -> enter any email/password).
  2. Open **Add Product**, fill fields and optionally upload an image.
  3. Submit and then reload the page — your product will remain available in the product lists.

Note: This is a demo persistence strategy (localStorage) to help review functionality without a backend. In production, save products via a server-side API.
